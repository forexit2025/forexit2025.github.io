# Help Notes

## Folder

This "components" folder contains features which form each page on our website.

Note: We have done our best to make the files as obvious as possible as to what they do or what it represents.

Every page you see on our website is formed by combined features together - think of it as different sections (i.e. every page has a footer and this is in the file `Footer.jsx`, a lot of pages uses some sort of card layout so we have a file which collects all the cards together called `Card.jsx`, etc). If you are working on a section and start to see a lot of repetition when you are writing code, you probably want to create a component if it doesn't already exist.

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **CARD COMPONENT**, edit the `Card.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **CONTACT COMPONENT**, edit the `Contact.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **FOOTER COMPONENT**, edit the `Footer.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **HEADER COMPONENT**, edit the `Header.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **MESSAGE SENT COMPONENT**, edit the `MessageSent.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **NAVIGATION MENU COMPONENT**, edit the `NavigationMenu.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **SCROLL TOP COMPONENT**, edit the `ScrollTop.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **TEAM GROUP COMPONENT**, edit the `TeamGroup.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **YEAR NAVIGATOR COMPONENT**, edit the `YearNavigator.jsx` file

- and so on...

- If you want to create a new component, make sure you are in the right folder (`.../components/`) and create a new file with the name of the file being the component name in pascal casing (i.e. if I wanted to create a component called **Price Graph**, the file would be `PriceGraph.jsx`)
