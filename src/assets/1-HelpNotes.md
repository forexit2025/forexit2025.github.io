## Folder

This "assets" folder is intended to contain images of FXA (i.e. people, logo, events etc). There are sub folders which categories the type of image you should be uploading to.

Note: Since we are using the `assets/` folder for most of the images, you must import the image: `import someImage from '../assets/some-image.jpg';` at the top of the relevant file you are working on.

- **`cp/` FOLDER:** consists of two sub folders `events/` and `publications/`
