# Help Notes

## Folder

This "pages" folder contains full page-level components which form the website.

Note: We have done our best to make the files as obvious as possible as to what they do or what it represents.

Every page you click on our website has a dedicated file (i.e. the landing page is called `Home.jsx`, the about us page is called `AboutUs.jsx`, etc).

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **HOME PAGE**, edit the `Home.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **ABOUT US PAGE**, edit the `AboutUs.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **OUR TEAM PAGE**, edit the `OurTeam.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **EVENTS PAGE**, edit the `Events.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **SPONSORS PAGE**, edit the `SponsorsAndPartners.jsx` file

- If you want to add/change/remove features in the **PUBLICATIONS PAGE**, edit the `Publications.jsx` file

- and so on...

- If you want to create a new page, make sure you are in the right folder (`.../pages/`) and create a new file with the name of the file being the page name in pascal casing (i.e. if I wanted to create a page called **Market News**, the file would be `MarketNews.jsx`)
